Conway's Game of Life in PHP.

## Usage

### Run

To run an example, just execute the `run` command and pass the file containing
the world definition.

    $ bin/conway run examples/gosper-glider-gun.gol

## Gif

You can render a run into an animated gif using the `gif` command. It's a good
idea to provide the number of generations with `-n`.

    $ bin/conway gif -n 300 examples/gosper-glider-gun.gol doc/gosper-glider-gun.gif

Note that performance is quite sluggish. On this machine it takes about 30
seconds to render 300 generations on the standard size grid of 120x50 cells.

Example output:

![glider gun](doc/gosper-glider-gun.gif)

## Mate Light

To render on a [Mate Light](https://github.com/jaseg/matelight) installation,
use the `matelight` command. You must supply the host name including the port.

	$ bin/conway matelight matelight.cbrp3.c-base.org:1337 examples/gosper-glider-gun.gol

It will connect over UDP and render onto the 40x16 grid.

## Installation

The `gif` command requires [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) to be
installed.
